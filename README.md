Container based development using OpenShift platform and k8s.


## First chapter
Talked about basic things. How to set up an project setup.

Every development should start with setting up basic things.

In this example we are looking `node.js`

1. Make sure to have nvm (Node version manger) that can be downloaded https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
2. You need to install `node.js` on your local env (macOS, linux, windows)
3. Git is essential to have your local env for version management
4. For publish your changes local -> Repository you should use GitHub, Bitbucket or whet ever you prefer to use. In this project we are using Github.
5. IDE is for VScode

If those things have been setup you can basically start develop.
First chapter also we covered version management. How to create branches, fork from another repository, merge requests etc.
